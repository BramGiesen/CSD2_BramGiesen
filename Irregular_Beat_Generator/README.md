Irregular Beat Generator by Bram Giesen

The Irregular Beat Generator is a command line program that generates beats in
odd timesignatures.

Open the userInput.py file to start the program.

The program has a few options:

1. You can choose between two time signatures, 5/4 and 7/8.
2. You can choose a BPM.
3. You can choose between a beat with only quarter notes for a very basic beat or a beat with
   quarter and eighth notes for more complex beats.
4. You can choose between a electric and acoustic drumsound for playback.
5. If you like the generated beat, you can save the beat as a MIDI-file.
